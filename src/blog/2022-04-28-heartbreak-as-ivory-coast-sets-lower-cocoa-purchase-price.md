  The purchase price of cocoa to farmers in Côte d'Ivoire, the world's leading producer, has been set at 825 CFA francs (1.25 euro) per kilo, at the opening of the 2021-2022 cocoa season, a drop of 17.5%, the Ivorian regulatory body for the sector announced Friday.


  During the previous campaign (2020-2021) which coincided with the presidential election of 2020 in Côte d'Ivoire, the price paid was 1,000 CFA francs (1.52 euros) per kilo, "an electoral price" had denounced the opposition.


  This Ivorian campaign starts after the establishment a few months ago by Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, two West African countries that account for about 60% of global cocoa, a body designed to ensure a remunerative price to farmers and "ensure sustainability of the cocoa economy.
